# Intro

1. Here we register (name, age, weight, height, sex)
2. We receive quests that we need to complete within the specified time box
3. If we did not we are gonna receive punishments (it is gonna be painful and should compensate the undone quest), can be achieved via implemented electronic shockers and it will shock every 5 minute unless we start exercise and burn the necessary amount of calories.
4. We need also "smart glasses"

# Pitfalls

1. We cannot use pnpm as our package manager :poop:
2. We do not have CSS, it is similar to CSS but not exactly CSS
